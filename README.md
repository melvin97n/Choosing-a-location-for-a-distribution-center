Choosing a neighborhood and coordinates for a distribution center for a grocery store to maximize business.
This is a rather basic project of my own in which I choose a neighborhood in NY to set up a distribution centre for a food supplier which is expanding. The limitation of each distribution center is that we have a maximum radius for distribution of 100km. So our goal is to choose a location which would give the maximum business.
